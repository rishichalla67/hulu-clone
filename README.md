### This is a React.JS portfolio project of a Hulu clone. 


## What I used:

React.JS, BootStrap, Material UI, Redux, IMDB API, and Axios

## What I learned:

I learned how to develop a working application from scratch and use axios in conjunction with the IMDB API to fetch the most updated movie titles and ratings for each genre of cinema. 

I spent plenty of time coding, but I spent majority of my time researching and trying to debug Redux and API issues. 

Material UI integration was seemeless and was very positively recieved.
